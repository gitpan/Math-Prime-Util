Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util.

0.04  7 June 2012
    - Didn't do tests on 32-bit machine before release.  Test suite caught
      problem with next_prime overflow.
    - Try to use 64-bit modulo math even when Perl is 32-bit.  It can make
      is_prime run up to 10x faster (which impacts next_prime, factoring, etc.)
    - replace all assert with croak indicating an internal error.
    - Add random_prime and random_ndigit_prime
    - renamed prime_free to prime_memfree.

    - Speed up factoring.
    - fixed powmod routine, speedup for smaller numbers
    - Add Miller-Rabin and deterministic probable prime functions.  These
      are now used for is_prime and factoring, giving a big speedup for
      numbers > 32-bit.
    - Add HOLF factoring (just for demo)
    - Next prime returns 0 on overflow

0.02  5 June 2012
    - Back off new_ok to new/isa_ok to keep Test::More requirements low.
    - Some documentation updates.
    - I accidently used long in SQUFOF, which breaks LLP64.
    - Test for broken 64-bit Perl.
    - Fix overflow issues in segmented sieving.
    - Switch to using UVuf for croaks.  What I should have done all along.
    - prime_count uses a segment sieve with 256k chunks (~7.9M numbers).
      Not memory intensive any more, and faster for large inputs.  The time
      growth is slightly over linear however, so expect to wait a long
      time for 10^12 or more.
    - nth_prime also transitioned to segmented sieve.
