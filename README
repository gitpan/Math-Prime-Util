Math::Prime::Util version 0.03

A set of utilities related to prime numbers.  These include multiple sieving
methods, is_prime, prime_count, nth_prime, approximations and bounds for
the prime_count and nth prime, next_prime and prev_prime, factoring utilities,
and more.

The default sieving and factoring are intended to be the fastest on CPAN,
including Math::Prime::XS, Math::Prime::FastSieve, and Math::Factor::XS.


SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Prime::Util qw/primes/;

  # Get a big array reference of many primes
  my $aref = primes( 100_000_000 );

  # All the primes between 5k and 10k inclusive
  my $aref = primes( 5_000, 10_000 );

See the POD module documentation for examples and more information on all the
methods included.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You will need a C compiler compatible with the compiler used to build Perl.
Since the routines are meant to be used from Perl, the data types will match
the ones used with the Perl you are installing for.  This means a 32-bit Perl
running on a 64-bit machine will result in a 32-bit library.


DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.6.2 or later.  No modules outside of Core have been used.
